# LC3 Simulator

_A Rust-based simulator and interface for the LC3 micro-architecture_

> *PennSim and 1000 other LC3 sims exist, so why does this exist?*
> 
> I was helping friends with LC3-based class projects at university, and got tired of PennSim's quirks.
> The memory view scroll speed in particular is atrocious, so I decided to see if I could do a better job.
> It also gave me a good excuse to learn more Rust :smile:.
